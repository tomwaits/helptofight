Containment Resource for fighting Covid 19.

# Where to Shop Safely during Covid-19 
This is a community-contributed resource for safer shopping. People just like you contribute what they've observed about local stores. We then grade the stores based on this set of best practices. Our goal is to encourage businesses to comply with containment policies to minimize the spread of Covid-19 virus and help keep our community safe.

Please help your neighbors and local businesses by adding and updating info or spreading the word.
